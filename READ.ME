# Challange Two Portfolio/Profile

In this activity I will create my own work portfolio.

## Steps

First I will create a html.index to start the profile.
Then I will add a css stylesheet to create a background annd custumize.
Using flexbox and media I will make the website easy to navigate.
I will also include links to my work.
At the very end I will have a profile with my content and a little part of who I am.
